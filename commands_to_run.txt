First turn on the environment:
source /Users/benvigoda/src/inductive_transformer_position/venv/bin/activate

How we are currently running the system:
python main.py training_text.txt inference_text.txt --train --num_layer 2 --layer_width 2 --num_data_points 1000

To use the test weights (which are themselves set in the hyperparameters.py file) add the --weight_test flag and remove the --train flag
python main.py training_text.txt inference_text.txt --weight_test --num_layer 2 --layer_width 2 --num_data_points 1000

To run perturbation tests and only set some of the weights, add the --perturbation flag and keep the --train flag
python main.py training_text.txt inference_text.txt --perturbation --train --num_layer 2 --layer_width 2 --num_data_points 1000


To get printing to google-sheet working you need to add a credentials.json file in the google_sheets_api directory.
The credentials.json should be in LastPass
The first time you try to print to google-sheet it will ask for some permissions and add a token.json file to the same directory
So long as this token.json file is there, you won't need to approve the permissions again.
