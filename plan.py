Ben:
- send to Jeff & Steve for feedback
- move pencil edits into appendices
- send to Bill and who else?
- go over every citation

Ben & Thomas:
- FIXME: DecoderBernoulliCategorical(nn.Module): forward() might have an error
- for extra credit: see if we can figure out the relationship between embeddings vectors and attention position

Thomas:
- fill in the diagram with all the weights with actual numbers
        - What do we do about the standard-deviations?
        - Write a quick script that does 100 runs and averages the weights?
        https://chat.openai.com/share/7378c48e-10d1-4d22-acae-7252f4840204
        Just put the training loop into its own loop. Store the weights at the end of the loops, average and compute std dev.

- proofread and spotcheck every step and equation
- review how Ben discusses marginalizing out position in the main body
- go over every citation too

results tables:
1. fill in some representative numbers in the black weights criss cross diagram which means we need final simulation results
2. do 100 training runs, fill in the weight means and variance averaged, this will only work on relu'd normalized weights


Ben:
- make slides for Tuesday if we are going to MIT
