open universe scaling:

Naively calculating this message requires a number of terms that is exponential in the number of parents, but can greatly simplify.  Note that the only probability mass for $p(\text{child}=0)$ is when all of the parents are 0's.  We can efficiently compute $p(\text{child}=0)$, and then $p(\text{child}=1) = 1 - p(\text{child}=0)$.  Note that the computed message is normalized.

\begin{eqnarray}
    p(\text{child}=0) &=& p(\text{parent}_0=0)p(\text{parent}_1=0) \nonumber \\
    p(\text{child}=1) &=& 1 - p(\text{child}=0),
\end{eqnarray}
FIXME: Are we allowed to do $1 - p(\text{child}=0)$

or in general,

\begin{eqnarray}
    p(\text{child}=0) &=& \prod_i p(\text{parent}_i=0) \nonumber \\
    p(\text{child}=1) &=& 1 - p(\text{child}=0),
\end{eqnarray}

For an arbitrary layer width we have,

\begin{align}
    p(\text{parent}_i = 1) &=  
    p(\text{child}=1) \sum_{j\neq i} \left( p(\text{parent}_j=0) + p(\text{parent}_j=1) \right) \nonumber \\
    p(\text{parent}_i = 0) &=  1 - p(\text{parent}_i = 1)
\end{align}
FIXME: Are we allowed to do $1 - p(\text{parent}_i = 1)$
